# About This Project

## What Is This Project?

Welcome to a unique repository designed for developers, educators, and anyone interested in integrating 3D molecular structures into their projects. This collection provides ready-to-use HTML and JavaScript code snippets, primarily based on 3Dmol.js, augmented with other web technologies like HTML5 and Plotly.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to simplify the integration of molecular visualization into educational content, websites, and learning management systems. We understand the challenges of coding complex 3D visualizations from scratch, so we've created a resource that offers a starting point for your projects.

## Features of the Collection

- **Ready-to-Use Code**: Each entry in our collection includes complete HTML/JavaScript code, set up and ready for implementation.
- **Diverse Range of Models**: From basic molecules to complex structures, our collection spans a wide range of molecular visualizations.
- **Interactive and Engaging**: Utilizing libraries like 3Dmol.js and Dygraph, the models are interactive, enhancing the user's learning and exploration experience.

## The Project Lead

The project is curated by [Dr. Dennis Svatunek](https://dsvatunek.com), whose expertise in chemistry and passion for educational technology led to the creation of this resource. His vision is to make molecular visualization more accessible to a broader audience.

## Utilizing Our Collection

Feel free to explore the collection and use the provided code snippets in your **non-commercial projects**. Educational uses, including university courses and academic research, are entirely encouraged and supported. Whether you're enhancing your educational website, building an interactive learning module, or creating digital content for your course, these models are here to serve as a valuable resource.

## Contribute and Collaborate

Your contributions are welcome! If you have a molecular model or a visualization technique that you'd like to share, please reach out. Together, we can expand this collection and continue to support educators and developers in the field of molecular science.
