# Want to Contribute?

There are three main ways you can contribute to our project:

## 1. Direct Contribution

If you're comfortable with HTML and JavaScript, you can directly contribute to the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/chemistry-in-3D/3Dify-Chemistry).

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Examine Similar Models**: Check out the code of similar models already in the project for insights on how to structure and implement your contribution. Save your final file as `DXXXX.markdown` in the `_data` folder, where 'XXXX' is a unique number not yet used in the project. This will be verified during the commit process.
- **Use the Model ID for DIV IDs**: To prevent conflicts with multiple models on the same page, use the model ID (`DXXXX`) as the `id` for your `div` elements.
- **Include Data Inline**: Scripts should be self-contained. The only exception is for loading minified JavaScript libraries from CDNs. Embed all necessary data directly within the script as variables.
- **Provide a Thumbnail**: Supply a square thumbnail image in PNG format. This should be placed in the `_data/thumbnails` folder.

## 2. Submit Your 3D Data

If you have 3D data but are not sure how to convert it into HTML/JavaScript format, you can submit it to us for inclusion. We'll handle the conversion and integration.

## 3. Suggest a Model

Have a specific model in mind that you'd like to see featured? Reach out to Dennis Svatunek with your proposal, and we'll consider adding it to the project.
